            <h3>How to Play:</h3>
             
                <p>Choose your chip value.</p>
                <p>Place chips on the betting layout. You can bet on specific numbers, ranges of numbers, colors (red/black), odd/even, or columns/dozens.</p>

        <section class="rules-section" id="coin-rules">
            <h2>Heads or Tails</h2>
            <h3>Objective:</h3>
            <p>Guess which side of the coin will land face up: Heads or Tails.</p>
            <h3>How to Play:</h3>
             
                <p>Set your bet amount.</p>
                <p>Choose "Heads" or "Tails".</p>

                <p>Set your bet amount and the number of mines you want on the grid (usually 1 to 24). More mines mean higher risk but also higher potential rewards.</p>
                <p>Click on tiles to reveal them.</p>
                <p>If you click a safe tile, your potential winnings increase.</p>
                <p>If you click a mine, you lose your bet.</p>

        <section class="rules-section" id="blackjack-rules">
            <h2>Blackjack</h2>
            <h3>Objective:</h3>
            <p>Get a hand total closer to 21 than the dealer, without exceeding 21.</p>
            <h3>How to Play:</h3>
             
                <p>Place your bet.</p>
                <p>You and the dealer are dealt two cards. Your cards are usually face up, one of the dealer's cards is face down (hole card).</p>
                <p>Card values: Number cards are face value. Face cards (J, Q, K) are 10. Aces are 1 or 11 (player's choice).</p>
                <p><strong>Actions:</strong>
                     
                        <p><strong>Hit:</strong> Take another card.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stand:</strong> Take no more cards.</p>
                        <p><strong>Double Down:</strong> Double your bet and take one more (and final) card.</p>
                        <p><strong>Split:</strong> If you have two cards of the same rank, split them into two separate hands (requires an additional bet).</p>
                     
                </p>
                <p>The dealer plays after all players. The dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more (rules vary slightly).</p>
                <p>If your hand total is higher than the dealer's without busting (going over 21), you win. If you get exactly 21 with your first two cards (Ace and 10-value card), it's a Blackjack!</p>

        <section class="rules-section" id="casino-war-rules">
            <h2>Casino War</h2>
            <h3>Objective:</h3>
            <p>Draw a card higher than the dealer's card.</p>
            <h3>How to Play:</h3>
             
                <p>Place your bet.</p>
                <p>You and the dealer each receive one card.</p>
                <p>If your card is higher than the dealer's, you win even money.</p>
                <p>If the cards are tied, you have two options:
                     
                        <p><strong>Surrender:</strong> Lose half your bet.</p>
                        <p><strong>Go to War:</strong> Double your initial bet. The dealer deals another card to both you and themselves. If your second card is higher, you win even money on the raised bet (your original bet pushes). If tied again, you win a bonus payout. If the dealer's card is higher, you lose both bets.</p>
                     
                </p>
                <p>Aces are always high.</p>

            <h3>How to Play:</h3>
             
                <p>Set your bet.</p>
                <p>You are dealt cards (e.g., 2 in Texas Hold'em, 5 in Five Card Draw). Community cards may also be dealt.</p>
                <p>The goal is to form the highest-ranking poker hand using your cards and any community cards.</p>
                <p><strong>Hand Rankings (from highest to lowest):</strong> Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, One Pair, High Card.</p>
                <p>Depending on the game variant (e.g., against other players, against the dealer), you may have options to bet, raise, or fold.</p>
                <p>The highest hand wins the pot (or beats the dealer).</p>
